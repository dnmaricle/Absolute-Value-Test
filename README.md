# Absolute-Value-Test
Students in our Intermediate Algebra class are required to understand absolute value. In order to accomplish this, this program was made. 
Students download this application and are able to complete three modules: learn, practice, and certify. Once students have gone through the
practice mode, they are able to take a 6 question test in class in order to pass this module.
